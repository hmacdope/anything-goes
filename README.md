# anything-goes

A repo for anything users/developers have done with OpenFF and want to share. 

We will approve basically any relevant PR. Your putting stuff here comes with no obligation to implement testing or provide support. Material here may be modified/overwritten by other people. Try to keep things under a few megabytes so we don't end up with an unmanageable git tree.

If you are in the org/have permissions and can merge without approval, please do! If not a maintainer will come around ASAP to approve your PR. You're free to merge any time GH isn't totally preventing you from doing so.

Provided entirely without support, endorsement, or warranty, either from the contributors or the Open Force Field Consortium/Initiative itself.
